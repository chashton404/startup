### Elevator pitch

Rollerskate racing is a fun game that allows both creativity and competition. It's all about designing the coolest rollerskates and then using that rollerskate to race against other players. When designing each skate, you can choose the color, type of design, and the color of the laces as well. Then... you RACE. Fastest skate wins!

### Design

![Rollerskate Race Image](appMockup.png)

This is a basic mockup for the rollerskate racing game. You can see that there are three sections for the game. Because this is my first time working with developing a website I'm going to be keeping the UI pretty simple, but still visually interersting for the user.

Down below I will be making in the sequence diagram. I just still need to learn how that works.

### Key features

- Secure Login
- Ability to design a skate and save it to your profile

- Race your skates against others
- View the leaderboard for the fastest times

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML Pages for login, landing page, skate design, skate library, and skate racing. 
- **CSS** - Make it adaptable to all of the different screens
- **React** - I will use react to allow the user to move between screens
- **Service** - I will use API's to allow the user to publish scores to a global leaderboard, and maybe one day you can even add friends and see their skates :)
- **DB/Login** - The user needs an account to see their totally wicked skates! They should login before starting
- **WebSocket** - This is what will be used to allow the user to see the other skate times
